Requires:
--------------------
 * npm 3.10.10 or greater



Instuctions:
---------------------
Fork this repository and clone it to your computer.

Open up a terminal window, navigate to the directory this read me resides in and run the following commands:

 * npm install
 * npm start

npm will try to run on port 3000. If that port is unavailable for some reason it will ask you if you'd like to run on a different port. If you respond "Yes" then it will find the next available port and run the app on it.

After that this app should be up and running.
